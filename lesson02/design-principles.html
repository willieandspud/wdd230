                    Free Faces is a website that showcases different typefaces. The website uses high-contrast colors, with off-white text against an almost-black background, to make each typeface stand out. The most important information is placed at the top of each typeface listing, with the least important at the bottom. This is to cater to readers' tendency to consume information from top to bottom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website uses repetition to group its offerings in a balanced three-item layout. This allows each typeface enough space to showcase its distinct characteristics. Each font is presented in the same size, giving visitors the freedom to choose their preferences. This indicates that no typeface is more significant than the other.

                    Lemonade is an innovative insurance company that uses AI technology to provide a simple yet comprehensive onboarding process to its customers. To achieve this, they use a step-by-step approach and employ psychology to keep their customers focused and engaged throughout the process. I appreciate how they offer a seamless mobile experience, and their use of icons instead of words on the desktop platform makes it easy to navigate and understand.

                <p>
                    The Staak Studio website is a great example of the effective use of the rule of thirds in web page design. By using a grid, they have strategically placed their attention-grabbing text and negative space. The graphic title text attracts the eye and leads it to the subtle descriptive text on the bottom left, creating a cohesive and visually appealing design.
