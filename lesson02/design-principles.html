                <h3>Adobe</h3>
                <p><a target="blank" href="https://www.Adobe.com">Adobe.com</a></p>

                    This website exemplifies Visual Hierarchy by using a clear heading to help organize the page's content and guide the user's attention. In this example "Next-generation AI. It's everything you can imagine." is bold and at the top of the page, immediately grabbing a viewers attention. After that, the viewer's attention will most likely move to "Free trail" and "Learn more" buttons, then to the body copy, and lastly to the "Adobe Photoshop" sub-heading. Through the use of varrying text size, negative space, and layout, this page has been given effective Visual Hierarchy.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <div class="cardcontent">
                <h3>Eames</h3>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eamesoffice.com/">Eamesoffice.com</a></p>
                <img src="images/eames.jpg" alt="Eames mobile screenshot">
                <p>
                    In this example the Rule of Thirds has helped to create a balanced and engaging layout. Key elements (headings, the logo, etc.) are all clearly visually aligned with each other, as you can see with the Rule of Thirds grid that has been superimposed on the screenshot. This helps to prioritize content and guide the viewer through the page. The logo and navigation menu are positioned in the top third of the screen, while the main content occupies the middle and bottom thirds.

            <h2>White Space</h2>
            <div class="cardcontent">
                <h3>1924us</h3>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.1924.us/">1924.us</a></p>
                <img src="images/1924.jpg" alt="1924us mobile screenshot">
                <p>
                    White Space is shown in this example by keeping things minimal and balanced. Though 1924us is fairly niche, they've been around for a while and don't need to utter much to their community about the products they offer. The White Space present here helps to focus the viewer to the products presented on the page. Even though body copy and calls to action are present, the heavy amount of White Space helps to draw the visitors focus to the products.
